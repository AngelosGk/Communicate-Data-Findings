### Overview 

#### Most popular APPS
he first finding was illustration of the top 8 most popular Apps using a histogram.According to the histogram Games Applications are the most popular among the user(almost half of the user download Games) following by Entertainment & Education Apps.
#### Distribution of Price in Game's Apps
In this section I investigated the Game's Apps prices included only Apps with charge. The majority of gameâ€™s costs approximately 0.99 $ as a charge for downloading.

#### TOP 10 Genre based on the users rating.

Despite the fact that Games are the most most popular among the users. Genres of Productivity & Music get higher user's rating than Games. So,these two variable have no positive correlation.

#### Genres with the highest sizes measured by bytes

User give empasis to the storage capacity that an APP could occupy.
According to the  piechart in my analysis Medical APPS occupy the highest mobile storage capacity.

#### Violin plot based on top 5 APPS highest mobile Apps storage capacity
Based on the violin plot we could summarize on Health & Fitness APPS have the highest size distribution and Bussiness APPS are the most normal distributed.

#### Prices based on Apps Genres
Using Boxplot I explore the distribution in pricing for four Apps (Games,Education,Health & Fitness,Entertainment) for applications that charges  less than 10$ for downloading .The variable with the highest distribution is games.Moreover,boxplot indicate as that games have the highest price while Enterainment apps charge the less and the average prices of (Games,Education,Health & Fitness) have quit similar value.



#### Multiple Correlation.
Finally, I order to compare the correlation between the variables (price', 'user_rating', 'sup_devices.num','size_bytes') I created a Heatmap . An unexpected finding is that there is a negative correlation between the price and the number of supported devices. That means that an App which could be supported by different types of devices is not so expensive than other which is supported by less.While, Price and user_rating have positive correlation.

### Summarizing
To conclude, we could say that the success of an application is based on different kind factors. User have high demands. Games applications are the most popular but also the most competitive genre. App creators must be very careful about a final decision taking into considerations a variety of factors.
